  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements well. All major sections (Hero, VehicleCatalog, DealerLocator, AboutSection, ContactForm, Footer, Navbar) are present with appropriate styling, backend logic, and interactivity. However, there is one notable gap: the backend only seeds 4 dealer entries instead of the required minimum of 10. Everything else — theme, CTAs, modal, filter tabs, timeline, values, form validation, toasts, footer links, social icons, image references — appears to be implemented.",
